# Welcome to Grobid-quantities's documentation!

Grobid-quantities is a ML-based application for identification, parsing and normalisation of any expressions of measurements (e.g. pressure, temperature, etc.) from text. 
This work focuses on technical and scientific articles and supports input data from raw text, PDF, and XML. 
Extracted measurements are normalised toward the base units from the International System of Units (SI).
