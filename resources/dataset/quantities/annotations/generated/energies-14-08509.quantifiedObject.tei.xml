    <p>This paper presents the design of an axial-flux permanent-magnet (AFPM) generator used for hybrid electric propulsion drone applications. The design objectives of the AFPM generator are high power density, which is defined as output power per generator weight, and high efficiency. In order to satisfy the requirements for the target application and consider the practical problems in the manufacturing process, the structure of the AFPM generator comprising a double-rotor single-stator (DR-SS) was studied. In order to determine the rotor topology and stator winding specifications that had the greatest impact on performance in the DR-SS type design process, we selected <measure type="value">three</measure> rotor models according to the arrangement of the magnetization direction and <measure type="value">three</measure> stator models according to the coreless winding specifications. These models were first compared and analyzed. Then, a 3-D finite element method was performed to calculate the magnetic, mechanical, and thermal characteristics of the designed models. By consideration of the output power, efficiency, temperature, and mechanical stability, etc., a topology suitable for the design of generators for UAV systems was determined and manufactured. The reliability of the design result was confirmed through the test.</p><p>Since axial-flux permanent-magnet (AFPM) generators are known to have a high power density, which is defined as the ratio of output power to weight <!--[1][2][3]-->, the authors of this paper reviewed the development of an AFPM electric machine for <measure type="value">3 kW</measure> class drones. Additionally, among the possible multiple rotor and stator combinations, a combination consisting of NS-type double rotors and a yokeless single stator (DR-SS) was selected, as shown in Figure 1. "NS type" refers to north pole and south pole magnets facing each other at either side; thus, the flux can travel straight through this stator without any circumferential flow <!--[4]-->. This type of DR-SS is more commonly known as a yokeless and segmented armature (YASA) motor or generator <!--[5][6][7]--> and is often described as having a relatively high power density because it does not require a stator yoke. However, to be precise, a structure in the form of a 'stator yoke' is not required as a magnetic flux path, but is necessary to mechanically hold the teeth and coils of the stator <!--[4]-->. Thus, the design of stator mechanical fixation in an NS-type DR-SS topology with a stator magnetic core (or stator teeth) becomes a critical part of the entire motor design process. Mechanically robust of stator mechanical fixation in an NS-type DR-SS topology with a stator magnetic core (or stator teeth) becomes a critical part of the entire motor design process. Mechanically robust structures are required to overcome the pull forces at both rotors, increasing the volume and weight of the stator <!--[4]-->. Therefore, in this study, we selected and designed a DR-SS topology without a stator core. For the rotors, in order to increase the output power, the characteristics of the model according to the combination of permanent-magnet (PM) pole arrangement were compared and reviewed, focusing on the so-called Halbach array structure [8,9]. For the stator, a coreless stator topology was used to reduce the weight of the stator itself and at the same time reduce the weight of the structure supporting it, by reducing the axial attraction force between the rotor and the stator.</p><p>This paper focuses on the process of selecting the rotor-Halbach array topology and the coil specifications of the coreless stator, which have the most influence on the power density among the various design variables of the rotor and stator in the generator design process.

However, in the case of a slotless or coreless stator that does not form teeth with a magnetic material (with or without a back yoke), the magnetic flux change occurs directly in the coil; thus, even at <quantifiedObject id="ee203f1c-e8a9-4767-bddd-82ec47eb6fc4">a low frequency of</quantifiedObject> several <measure type="value" ptr="#ee203f1c-e8a9-4767-bddd-82ec47eb6fc4">hundred Hz</measure>, severe eddy current loss can happen in the coil depending on the diameter of the conductor. Although DC resistance and AC resistance losses occur only in the state of load operation with the current flowing, eddy current loss in the coil occurs not only during load operation but also during no-load operation.</p><p>The best way to reduce the eddy current loss of a conductor is to use Litz wire that divides the conductor into multiple strands. However, when using Litz wires with each coated strand for winding, the number of turns that can be wound around the same coil cross-sectional area is reduced by <measure type="value">half</measure> compared to the normal conductor. Therefore, when using Litz wire, an increase in the volume of the motor or generator is inevitable because the coil cross-sectional area must be at least doubled or the rotor PM size and the number of coil turns must be increased to achieve the same output power as a model using a normal conductor.</p><p>In addition, the relative comparison with the coil model is important, so it was calculated only as the maximum average magnetic flux density in <measure type="value" ptr="#5ca4b7a5-7c3d-4e54-8e0c-ad26f5e12ac4">one</measure> <quantifiedObject id="5ca4b7a5-7c3d-4e54-8e0c-ad26f5e12ac4">straight conductor</quantifiedObject>.

However, since the Coil-III model makes the stator coil with Litz wire so that the conductor eddy current loss is also negligible, most of the measured losses of the Coil-III model can be considered as mechanical losses. Since all were made under the same conditions except for the stator winding, the mechanical losses of the Coil-I and Coil-II models are evaluated similarly to those of Coil-III. After subtracting the mechanical loss of Coil-III from the measured losses of Coil-I and Coil-II, it can be seen that the eddy current loss values of Coil-I and Coil-II models are similar to the calculated values.</p><p>At the bottom of Table 4, the temperatures in the coil measured during the no-load test of each model are compared.

The housing of the manufactured generator is as shown in Figure 1, and the temperature of Coil-I and Coil-II was severely increased while the room temperature was <measure type="value">25 degrees</measure> Celsius across the board. From the comparison of Coil-I and Coil-II, it can be seen that the effect of the parallel circuit with the possibility of a circulating current is not large; rather, the loss decreases as the conductor diameter decreases. This can confirm that the loss is significantly reduced in Coil-III, which has the smallest conductor diameter. Therefore, the stator was determined with the Coil-III model that could completely reduce the conductor eddy current loss as a heat source.</p><p>First, centrifugal force causes the deviation of PMs arranged in the circumferential direction of the edges of the rotor yoke. The ma<quantifiedObject id="0f7f39cc-699e-41a3-b4b4-a8e384dc7a4c">in cause is </quantifiedObject>the occurrence of shear stress by centrifugal force on the plane where the rotor frame and PM are bonded [14]. The upper part of Figure 8 shows the cross-section of the designed generator rotor, which has rim parts with a height that is <measure type="value" ptr="#0f7f39cc-699e-41a3-b4b4-a8e384dc7a4c">75%</measure> of PM thickness to prevent the deviations in the radial direction of the PMs caused by centrifugal force. Finally, the rotor dynamics were performed to confirm the dynamic stability of the rotor system. Figure 9 is the Campbell diagram showing the result of the analysis. The critical speed, which is when the natural vibration mode is the bending mode of the rotating shaft, was shown to be <measure type="value">18,302 rpm</measure>. This is illustrated in the mode shape shown in the lower right-hand corner of Figure 10. More than <measure type="interval">20%</measure> of the separation margin was secured for the maximum operating speed of the generator at <measure type="value">7000 rpm</measure>, and no whirling vibration of the rotor system was expected to occur. Second, the axial attraction force due to the magnetism of the PMs attached to the <measure type="value" ptr="#88434521-7d9d-4fa3-81b5-f562d3e3cbc7">two</measure> <quantifiedObject id="88434521-7d9d-4fa3-81b5-f562d3e3cbc7">rotors</quantifiedObject> causes a bending moment with the hub part assembled on the rotary axis as a support, resulting in deflection [15,16]. The direction of deflection is the direction of reducing the air gap, which in turn reduces the performance and stability of the generator, and a robust design of the rotor frame is required. To increase the stiffness in the axial direction of the rotor frame, the stiffener was designed as shown in the upper part of Figure 8 and the thickness of the hub acting as the support was designed to be relatively thicker than the outer part.</p><p>A stress analysis was performed to check the designed rotor frame's deflection and stress distribution by magnetic force, and the lower part of Figure 8 is the result of this stress analysis. The maximum deflection was shown at the edge of the rotor frame at <measure type="value">0.11 mm</measure>, which means there was a maximum reduction of <measure type="value" ptr="#b0bab610-1b24-439c-a567-535012d8662d">22%</measure> in the designed <measure type="value" ptr="#04b57970-1b75-403f-a205-8b5eaf689ab6">0.5 mm</measure> air-<quantifiedObject id="04b57970-1b75-403f-a205-8b5eaf689ab6">gap length</quantifiedObject>.

The yield strength of S45C, the material of the rotor frame, is <measure type="list">490</measure> Mpa, and the maximum stress that occurred was lower than this, meaning that it was mechanically stable.</p><p>Energies 2021, <measure type="value">14, 8509 9</measure> of <measure type="value" ptr="#82b5c1dd-124a-46f8-8756-4f99b6e7b2ea">14</measure> Finally, <quantifiedObject id="82b5c1dd-124a-46f8-8756-4f99b6e7b2ea">the rotor dynamics</quantifiedObject> were performed to confirm the dynamic stability of the rotor system. Figure 9 is the Campbell diagram showing the result of the analysis.

Since Litz wire and segmented PM were used, the eddy current loss in the coil and PM was negligible, and the main heat source was the DC copper loss. The other heat sources were core losses in the rotor yoke and mechanical losses in the bearings. Although copper loss and iron loss can be calculated through parameters obtained through electromagnetic field analyses and empirical formulas [17][18][19][20][21][22], respectively, mechanical loss varies depending on the parts and the manufacturing method of the manufactured model. Therefore, it was assumed that the mechanical loss was about <measure type="value" ptr="#b32dfff8-ff92-4be3-bd07-76e4a8e2d951">7%</measure> of the <measure type="value" ptr="#9518957d-f2ac-470d-ba00-4af27b929e31">3 kW</measure> <quantifiedObject id="9518957d-f2ac-470d-ba00-4af27b929e31">rated output power</quantifiedObject> with reference to the prototype reviewed, until the final model was decided. Moreover, it was assumed that the generator operated under natural cooling conditions at a room temperature of <measure type="value" ptr="#4743c2f2-7ef2-4554-81c3-7e99765bcd91">28 • C</measure>. <quantifiedObject id="4743c2f2-7ef2-4554-81c3-7e99765bcd91">All input parameters</quantifiedObject> for the analysis are shown in Table 5.</p><p>The connection coefficient, defined in the boundaries of the model, used empirical values. In the case of the rotor yoke, the values of <measure type="list">100</measure> and 200 W/m2K were applied to the inner and outer surfaces of the rotor, respectively, considering that rotation resulted in a fan-like cooling effect. On the other hand, the jig was separated into a top plate and a bottom plate, and the jig top plate to which the generator was attached had only a slight flow of air, with a value of <measure type="value" ptr="#25bd37b1-e3b8-4d90-b838-4fc20dfbf1a3">10</measure> <quantifiedObject id="25bd37b1-e3b8-4d90-b838-4fc20dfbf1a3">W/m2K</quantifiedObject> applied. The lower plate of the jig was defined as Energies 2021, <measure type="value">14, 8509 10 of 14</measure> infinite, assuming a situation in which heat could escape infinitely due to its connection to the dynamo steel base. The final designed model including the test jig was modeled in <measure type="value" ptr="#84c0e900-18a2-49a3-afff-495a74ac9669">3</measure><quantifiedObject id="84c0e900-18a2-49a3-afff-495a74ac9669">D</quantifiedObject> as shown in Figure 10a, and the thermal analysis was performed using FEM [23][24][25][26]. When the temperature was saturated, the highest temperature was the stator coil with the largest loss, as shown in Figure 10b. Table 6 shows the range of temperature distribution by dividing the generator into coils, rotor yokes, PMs, and bearings. Representatively, when looking at the material used for coils and PMs that are most vulnerable to temperature, Litz wire has a class F thermal index with a maximum operating point of <measure type="list">155 • C</measure>, and PM with SH grade has a maximum operating point of <measure type="value">150 • C</measure>. It can be seen that the heat generated by the generator during the rated operation is in the stable range.</p><p>The prototype of the model was finally decided based on the electromagnetic field design and mechanical thermal analysis that were produced as shown in Figure 11. In order to check whether the PM arrangement of the rotor composed of the Halbach array was properly manufactured, the magnetic flux density of the PM surface was measured, as shown in Figure 11a. As compared in Figure 12, it can be confirmed that the trends of the predicted values and the measured values match well through the electromagnetic field analysis. Higher harmonics appearing in the analysis compared to the measured values can be regarded as calculation errors according to the element mesh state. As shown in Figure 13, a dynamo set was constructed to test the generator. By connecting a <measure type="value">2 ohm</measure> resistive load per phase to the generator, a power <quantifiedObject id="300ceccd-eed7-4366-bc30-06762715f9b3">generation output of</quantifiedObject> <measure type="value" ptr="#300ceccd-eed7-4366-bc30-06762715f9b3">3.1 kW</measure> could be obtained at <measure type="value">6500 rpm</measure>. A higher output power could be achieved by connecting a resistor of <measure type="value" ptr="#fe28face-5ccd-4096-ab09-ea2c3997c002">1 ohm</measure> per phase to the generator. Figure 14a shows the no-load test results according to speed.

In the no-load operation, it can be seen that the back EMF is linear with speed, whereas the power loss is non-linear. When the resistive load is <measure type="value">2 ohm</measure>, the rated power of <measure type="value" ptr="#5447dbc3-80f8-449b-85f7-94d232700ae6">3 kW</measure> <quantifiedObject id="5447dbc3-80f8-449b-85f7-94d232700ae6">output</quantifiedObject> occurs at around <measure type="value">7000 rpm</measure>, and the mechanical loss at this time is about <measure type="value" ptr="#14f7bb26-434f-4f0f-b051-dcb745db6720">200 W</measure>. On the other hand, when the resistive load is <measure type="value">1 ohm</measure>, the rated output power occurs at around <measure type="value">5000 rpm</measure>, and it can be seen that the mechanical loss at this time is about 100 W. It was confirmed through the test that the maximum efficiency was <measure type="value">93.2%</measure> at <measure type="value" ptr="#3a6920c9-53fa-48bd-80df-2acfb6604cfd">3000 rpm</measure> when the resistive load was <measure type="value">2 ohm</measure>, and the As shown in Figure 13, a dynamo set was constructed to test the generator.
