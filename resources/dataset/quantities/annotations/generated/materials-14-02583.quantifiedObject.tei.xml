In this application, higher magnetism is required. Since the invention of Nd-Fe-B magnets in <measure type="value">1983</measure>, the remanence (J r ) and the maximum energy product (BH) max of the Nd-Fe-B magnets reached the theoretical values, while the H cj is only <measure type="value" ptr="#e4362080-98aa-465a-a626-154393248aa5">30%</measure> of the theoretical value <!--[3]-->. However, the higher H cj is urgently proposed in the face of increasingly harsh working environments, especially in high-temperature and high-humidity climates <!--[4][5][6]-->. There are basically <measure type="value" ptr="#6e75b272-a66f-4dd7-a97c-777fbcc419dd">two</measure> <quantifiedObject id="6e75b272-a66f-4dd7-a97c-777fbcc419dd">ways</quantifiedObject> to develop high coercivity. One is to improve the inherent temperature dependence of H cj , and the other is to develop higher coercivity at room temperature to resist thermal demagnetization of the magnets when exposed to high temperature. Heavy rare earth elements Dy/Tb can be substituted for Pr/Nd to increase the magneto-crystalline anisotropy field (H A ), causing a substantial enhancement of H cj by a single alloying method. However, due to the antiferromagnetic coupling between Dy and Fe, it is unfavorable to the saturation magnetization [7,8]. In order not to sacrifice the saturation magnetization, the GBDP (grain boundary diffusion process) technique was proposed by Park et al.<!-- [9] -->. Heavy rare earth elements can be selectively diffused into the magnet interior along the grain boundary (GB), forming a hard core-shell structure surrounding the main grains. Later, researchers successively used heavy rare earth metals/compounds/alloys containing Dy or Tb, such as Dy, Dy 2 O 3 , DyF 3 , DyH 2 , and Dy-Cu or Pr-Dy-Cu [10][11][12][13][14] acting as diffusion sources to improve the H cj .</p><p>In addition, the non-rare-earth elements Al/Ga/Cu can also increase the H cj of the sintered Nd-Fe-B magnets and reduce the irreversible loss of magnetic flux. These elements mainly enrich in the RE-rich (Rare-earth rich) liquid phase to improve the wettability and increase the coercivity of the magnets [17][18][19].

The magnetic properties at different temperatures were measured by a boron hydride tracer (NIM-500C, National Institute of Metrology, Beijing, China). The melting points of the alloys were measured by differential scanning calorimetry (DSC250, TA Instruments, USA). Additionally, the microstructure of the magnets was observed by a field emission scanning electron microscope (FESEM, MLA650F, FLIR Systems, Inc., Wilsonville, OR, USA). The irreversible magnetic flux loss at elevated temperatures was measured by pulling Helmholtz coils. The phase constitution of the magnets was determined by the X-ray diffraction with a Cu-K α radiation (XRD, D8 Advance, Bruker, Billerica, MA, USA). The elemental distribution of Nd-Fe-B magnets was explored by using an electron probe microanalyzer (EPMA, JXA-8530F, JEOL, Tokyo, Japan). The recoil loops of the magnets were measured by the Physical Property Measurement System (PPMS-DynaCOOL1-9, Quantum Design, San Diego, CA, USA) in fields up to 5 T at room temperature. lower melting points. Additionally, the lower melting point may reduce the activatio energy of the diffusion and improve diffusion efficiency.

The structure loss occurs at a high temperature, which leads to demagnetization. The irreversible flux loss is not recoverable when back to room temperature. It is related to the irreversible change of the microstructure of the magnets. The GB microstructure of the diffused magnets was optimized after thermal diffusion treatment. The nucleation of the reverse magnetic domain of the magnets is suppressed, and it is difficult to trigger the magnetization reversal of the magnetic domain due to the hardening of the epitaxial layer of the matrix phase grain [22]. This results in an improvement in temperature coefficients and irreversible magnetic flux losses of the diffused magnets.

The dark gray parts in Figure 5 correspond to the <measure type="value">2:14:1</measure> matrix phase grains, and the bright white and gray white areas correspond to the RE-rich phases. The bright white and gray white in SEM are caused by the difference in composition of the RE-rich phases. Figure 5a shows that the triple junction RE-rich phases of the original magnets were distributed discretely in the magnet interior, and some adjacent matrix phase grains were in direct contact, which is unfavorable to the Hcj.

If all grains are surrounded by thin grain boundary phases, then the grains are magnetically isolated from each other. If the grains are in direct contact with each other, there will be a localized exchange coupling effect, and, as a result, the grains are connected together to form a larger ferromagnetic domain grain group. A small grain inversion will drive demagnetization of adjacent grains in chains, because there is no thin layer RE-rich phase boundary, which will not hinder the displacement of the domain wall [23].

Dy elements are mainly distributed in the main phase grain epitaxial layer to form the (Dy, Pr/Nd)2Fe14B core-shell structure, which is beneficial to increase the coercivity. During the GBDP, Dy penetrates into the Nd-Fe-B sintered magnets through liquid grain boundaries. The Dy-rich shells are only selectively formed on the low-index lattice plane of the main phase grains. These planes, generated by the partial melting of the main phase grains, offer the low-energy configurations at the Nd2Fe14B/GB interfaces [24]. During the subsequent cooling process, the Dy-rich liquid phases precipitate on the edge of the main phase grains and solidify to form (Nd, Dy)2Fe14B hard shells. As shown in Figure 6a, a large amount of Dy elements accumulated on the surface of the Dy70Al10Ga20 diffused magnets, while <quantifiedObject id="266bf6c9-6fcb-4bbd-ba0c-b4515333ba79">the enrichment on</quantifiedObject> the (Pr75Dy25)<measure type="value" ptr="#266bf6c9-6fcb-4bbd-ba0c-b4515333ba79">70Al10</measure>Ga20 diffused magnets is mitigated.

According to the distribution of Al and Ga in Figure 6b, most of them remain in the grain boundaries and play a role in wetting the grain boundaries [18]. At the same time, a small amount of Al also exists in the matrix grains, which is possible when the surface of the Nd-Fe-B grains is partially decomposed, and Dy replaces Nd atoms. Meanwhile, Al penetrates into the selected grain facets from the grain boundaries with a high concentration at the grain edges. With a cooling effect coming in place, lighter Al atoms get transported inwards due to the low melting point while matrix restructuring happens, known as core-shell morphology [27]. Although the core-shells are not obvious, a higher concentration of Pr at the grain boundaries takes precedence of surface diffusion by the substitution of Nd atoms, resulting in the intergranular region becoming richer with Nd and hard phase grains taking composition (Pr, Nd)2Fe14B. Therefore, under the combined effect of the above elements, the hard core-shell structure and optimized microstructure can explain the reason why the diffused magnets have an increased Hcj after GBDP.</p><p>To investigate the diffusion depth of Dy in different diffused magnets, the EPMA was performed to determine the distribution of the Dy element along the diffusion direction.

As can be seen from Figure 7(a2,b2), a high concentration of the Dy-rich area is formed on the surface of the magnet, and the Dy-rich area is indicated by the red ellipses in Figure 7(a2,b2). It can be seen from the red rectangular box that the concentration of the Dy element in the <measure type="value" ptr="#90fbc689-32e8-471c-89a2-2c7c687bad9e">6</measure> after the GBDP, respectively.

(Pr75Dy25)<measure type="value">70Al10</measure>Ga20 diffused magnets is higher than that of the Dy70Al10Ga20 diffused magnets. With the diffusion depth increasing, the Dy-rich area gradually decreases. At <quantifiedObject id="193e8cfc-157d-4c93-8600-73d1404d7122">the depth of</quantifiedObject> <measure type="value" ptr="#193e8cfc-157d-4c93-8600-73d1404d7122">400 μm</measure>, the Dy element still exists in the magnet interior. At the same time, it is observed that the concentration of Dy in the (Pr75Dy25)<measure type="value">70Al10</measure>Ga20 diffused magnets is higher than that of the Dy<measure type="value">70Al10Ga20</measure> diffused magnets at the same depth as the dotted lines in Figure 7(a2,b2). Therefore, the quaternary alloy (Pr75Dy25)<measure type="value">70Al10</measure>Ga20 can save the Dy elements and promote its diffusion depth. For sintered Nd-Fe-B, the GB provides a channel for the diffusion source. The melting point of the RE-rich grain boundary phase is about <measure type="value">655 °C</measure>, which is much lower than the melting point of <quantifiedObject id="74000ade-7a84-493d-a20d-a6aba1d700a6">the main phase of</quantifiedObject> <measure type="value" ptr="#74000ade-7a84-493d-a20d-a6aba1d700a6">1185 °C</measure> [28]. The element diffusion follows the Fick's second law, which states that in the process of unsteady diffusion, we get</p><p>where cx, c0, and cs are the volume concentrations of the diffusion material (kg/m 3 ) at the different depths; A is a fixed value (when the surface concentration and time are determined); and x is the distance (m)<!-- [7] -->. Figure 8 shows the fitting curve of the Dy element concentration in the range of different depths in the diffused magnets. Additionally, the diffusion coefficients of the Dy element are approximately <measure type="interval">4.988 ± 0.673</measure> × <measure type="interval">10 -7 cm 2 /s</measure> and <measure type="interval">3.139 ± 0.101</measure> × <measure type="interval">10 -7 cm 2 /s</measure> in the (Pr75Dy25)<measure type="value" ptr="#c0a9dc34-ace6-4527-bb9e-dd732f63905e">70Al10</measure>Ga20 and Dy70Al10Ga20 <quantifiedObject id="c0a9dc34-ace6-4527-bb9e-dd732f63905e">diffused magnets</quantifiedObject>, respectively. This also shows that the diffusion efficiency of the Dy elements in the quaternary alloys (Pr75Dy25)<measure type="value">70Al10</measure>Ga20 is improved under the cooperation of the Pr elements. The concentration of the Dy element can be measured by <quantifiedObject id="ca28e4b0-2c18-4481-b0e5-1d12a5f9e947">EPMA along</quantifiedObject> the diffusion direction from the <measure type="value" ptr="#ca28e4b0-2c18-4481-b0e5-1d12a5f9e947">0 μm</measure> to <measure type="value">450 μm</measure> in a continuous <measure type="interval">100 × 100</measure> <quantifiedObject id="b45f165c-90c0-4427-9f93-e502e3502e22">μm</quantifiedObject> <measure type="value" ptr="#b45f165c-90c0-4427-9f93-e502e3502e22">2 square</measure> indicated by the red boxes in Figure 7(a1,b1). As the diffusion depth increases, the concentration of Dy elements decreases, and the diffusion rate slows down. Figure 9 gives a schematic diagram of the change in the amount of diffusion distinguished from the depth of the diffused magnets [29]. Figure 9a,b show the diffusion mechanism of ternary alloys Dy<measure type="value">70Al10</measure>Ga20 and quaternary alloys (Pr75Dy25)<measure type="value">70Al10</measure>Ga20, respectively. During the heat treatment, Dy atoms enter the magnet along the grain boundaries. By replacing Nd atoms with Dy atoms, a thin layer with higher Dy concentration is formed on the edge of the main phase grains, which is called the core-shell structure. The quaternary alloys (Pr75Dy25)<measure type="value">70Al10</measure>Ga20 have the coordinated diffusion of the Pr element, so that the Dy element can penetrate deeper into the magnets and form a more core-shell structure. At the same time, the surface Dy concentration of the magnets can be regulated by diffusing (Pr75Dy25)<measure type="value">70Al10Ga20</measure> alloys. Due to the magnetic isolation effect of the grain boundaries and the high magnetocrystalline anisotropy field of the core-shell structure, the coercivities of the diffused magnets show improvement after the GBDP treatment. For sintered Nd-Fe-B, the GB provides a channel for the diffusion source. The melting point of the RE-rich grain boundary phase is about <measure type="value">655 • C</measure>, which is much lower than the melting point of the main phase of <measure type="value">1185</measure> • C [28]. The element diffusion follows the Fick's second law, which states that in the process of unsteady diffusion, we get</p><p>where c x , c 0 , and c s are the volume concentrations of the diffusion material (kg/m 3 ) at the different depths; A is a fixed value (when the surface concentration and time are determined); and x is the distance (m)<!-- [7] -->. The recoil loops can verify the magnitude of the demagnetization capability and the uniformity of the microstructure [17]. Figure 10 shows the recoil loops of the original magnets, and the Dy70Al10Ga20 and (Pr75Dy25)<measure type="value">70Al10</measure>Ga20 diffused magnets.

Figure 10 the Dy element enrichment on the surface of the Dy70Al10Ga20 diffused magnets leads to the larger opening of the recoil loops than that of the (Pr75Dy25)<measure type="value">70Al10</measure>Ga20 diffused magnets.
